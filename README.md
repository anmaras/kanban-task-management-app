### What I learned

During the development of this Kanban Task Management App, I learned several valuable skills and gained knowledge, including:

- Building a Full-Stack Application: I gained experience in developing a full-stack application using React for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, and MongoDB as the database.

- Implementing Drag and Drop Functionality: I learned how to implement drag and drop functionality using the react-beautiful-dnd library to enable users to move tasks between columns and change their order.

- Validating Forms: I learned how to use Formik and Yup to validate forms and provide users with feedback in real-time when they enter invalid data.

- Handling HTTP Requests: I learned how to use Axios to handle HTTP requests to the server to create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks.

### Continued development

- Notifications and reminders: Adding notifications and reminders for tasks that are due or overdue could help users stay on track and meet their deadlines.
